              Joshua Sarmiento Guintu, the founder of J’SPHOTOGRAPHY, is a graduate 
              of Industrial Engineering with a strong passion for photography that began 
              during high school. As a student, he served as the president of the school's 
              photography club, where he honed the creative and technical skills that 
              would later become the foundation of a professional career. <br><br>
              Although he pursued a degree in Industrial Engineering, his passion for 
              visual storytelling remained constant. This passion ultimately inspired the 
              establishment of a photo and video services business that combines 
              artistic vision with the precision and problem-solving mindset developed 
              through his engineering background. <br><br>
              Today, Joshua S. Guintu together with his wife, Arianne Joyce R. Guintu 
              leads J’SPHOTOGRAPHY with a commitment to delivering high-quality, 
              creative, and memorable visual content. The business stands as a 
              testament to the idea that pursuing one’s passion—backed by dedication 
              and professional excellence—can lead to meaningful and fulfilling work.

              <div class="stories-title1">How It All Started </div>
              <div class="stories-text1">Our story began with a passion that took root in high school—photography. Our founder, a former photography club 
                president, found joy in capturing meaningful moments and telling stories through the lens. Though he pursued a 
                degree in Industrial Engineering, the creative spark never faded. After graduation, this passion evolved into a full
                fledged photo and video services business—one built on creativity, dedication, and a desire to turn special 
                moments into lasting memories. </div>

            <div class="stories-2">
              <div class="stories-title2">Challenges Encountered </div>
              <div class="stories-text2">As with many startups, the early stages were filled with challenges: limited resources, stiff competition, and the 
                task of building a nsame in a saturated market. Establishing trust with clients, managing operations, and 
                maintaining quality with minimal manpower were just a few of the obstacles we faced.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="stories-3">
              <div class="stories-title3"> Overcoming Problems and Turning Them into Opportunities</div>
              <div class="stories-text3">We took each challenge as an opportunity for growth. By reinvesting in training, equipment, and continuously 
                improving our skills, we were able to raise the quality of our services. Our background in Industrial Engineering 
                helped streamline business processes, while the involvement of our co-owner—who is also a teacher—greatly 
                contributed to managing client communications, schedules, and logistics with care and professionalism. Her 
                people skills and organized approach have been invaluable in building client trust and satisfaction. Over time, our 
                clients became our best promoters—many of them returning for repeat services and referring friends and family to 
                us. Their loyalty and feedback have been central to our growth.</div>
